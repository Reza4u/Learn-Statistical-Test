    "    *   Test selection is a systematic process.\n",
    "    *   Understand your data and research question first.\n",

    "    *   Open the floor for questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slide Design Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Keep it Clean:** Minimal text, maximum impact.\n",
    "*   **Visuals are Key:**\n",
    "    *   **Flowcharts/Decision Trees:** Absolutely essential for this topic. Build them step-by-step on the slide or show the full one and then zoom into sections.\n",
    "    *   **Tables:** For comparing parametric vs. non-parametric, or assumptions.\n",
    "    *   **Simple Diagrams:** To illustrate concepts like independent vs. paired.\n",
    "*   **Consistent Formatting:** Use the same fonts, colors, and layout throughout.\n",
    "*   **Use Icons:** To represent concepts like \"groups,\" \"time,\" \"data type.\"\n",
    "*   **Examples (Optional but Recommended):** For each test, a very brief, relatable example can solidify understanding. E.g., \"Student's t-test: Comparing average test scores of two different teaching methods.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Make it Better for Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Start with the \"Why\":** Emphasize the consequences of choosing the wrong test.\n",
    "2.  **Build a Decision Tree/Flowchart:** This is the single most effective visual for this topic. Start simple and add complexity.\n",
    "3.  **Focus on the \"When\" and \"Why\":** Instead of just listing tests, explain the scenarios where each is appropriate.\n",
    "4.  **Highlight Assumptions and Alternatives:** This is your core strength. Make it clear that violating assumptions doesn't mean the end of the world, but requires a different approach.\n",
    "5.  **Use Consistent Language:** For assumptions, data types, etc.\n",
    "6.  **Interactive Elements (if possible):** If it's a smaller group, you could pose a simple scenario and ask the audience which test they'd choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "By structuring your presentation around the decision-making process and using strong visuals like flowcharts, you'll create a highly effective and memorable guide for choosing statistical tests. Good luck!"

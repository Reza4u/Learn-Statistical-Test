    "1.  **Non-Inferiority (NI) Design:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Can you explain the core concept of a non-inferiority trial versus a superiority trial? Why was NI chosen here?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   What does the \"non-inferiority margin\" (Δ = 10%) practically mean in the context of this clinical trial? How was this specific 10% value decided upon, and what clinical considerations went into it?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Why do we typically use a one-sided significance level (like the 2.5% mentioned for the CI bound) when testing the NI hypothesis, even if we calculate a two-sided CI?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Could you walk me through Figure 1? Can we discuss hypothetical scenarios (e.g., if the CI was [-8%, +2%] or [-15%, -5%]) and interpret them using this figure (A-H)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   What are the regulatory implications (e.g., for drug approval) of demonstrating non-inferiority versus superiority?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Hypotheses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For the primary aim (Aim 1, Day 3), the hypotheses are H0: μ1 – μ2 ≤ -Δ and H1: μ1 – μ2 \\> -Δ. Can you break down what μ1, μ2, and Δ represent here in simple terms? Why is the hypothesis structured this way for NI?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   How do the hypotheses differ for the secondary clinical aims (Day 7, Day 30) and the microbiological aim (Aim 2)? Are they also NI?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Aim 4 (resistance) is stated as a superiority hypothesis test. How does the statistical approach differ here compared to the NI aims?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Sample Size Calculation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The SAP mentions assuming a 97% success rate (or 3% failure rate) and needing 46 confirmed cases per arm for 80% power. Can you walk me through the inputs and logic of this calculation? What formula or software might be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   How sensitive is the required sample size to the assumed success rate (97%) and the NI margin (10%)? What if the true success rate is lower?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   How was the inflation from 46 confirmed cases per arm (92 total) to 132 enrolled children determined (considering 75% confirmation rate and 5% dropout)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**II. Analysis Populations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **ITT vs. mITT vs. Per Protocol (PP):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Can you clearly define the Intention-to-Treat (ITT), modified ITT (mITT), and Per-Protocol (PP) populations specifically for this study based on the SAP descriptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Why is it important to analyze the data using multiple populations (ITT, mITT, PP)? What does each population tell us?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For a non-inferiority trial, which analysis population (ITT, mITT, or PP) is generally considered the most critical for the primary conclusion, and why? The SAP mentions analysis \"will be by\" all three, but is one primary?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   How does the handling of protocol deviations (major vs. minor) influence who is included in the PP population?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The SAP states children who withdraw consent or miss follow-up are retained in ITT/mITT but assigned failure. What is the rationale for assigning failure versus trying to impute data? How might this impact the results, particularly the NI conclusion?\n",
    "\n",
    "**III. Outcome Definitions & Measurement**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Primary Outcome (Clinical Failure Day 3):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Can you break down the components of the \"Clinical Failure\" definition? Are they weighted equally (e.g., is fever considered as severe a failure as death)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   How will nuances be handled? (e.g., a transient fever on Day 3 morning but resolved by evening? How is \"abdominal pain/tenderness\" objectively measured across different assessors?)\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   If a child meets the failure criteria before Day 3 (e.g., hospitalized on Day 2), how is this handled in the Day 3 analysis? (Appears to be counted as failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Secondary Outcomes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For Clinical Failure (Day 7/30) and Microbiological Failure (Day 7/30), the SAP mentions carrying forward the Day 3 outcome if treatment changed due to clinical failure. Why is this approach used? What are alternative approaches, and why might they not have been chosen?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For Microbiological Failure, what is the rationale for the Ct value cutoff (\\<30 or \\<35)? How does PCR detection compare to culture in terms of identifying true infection/clearance?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   How will Adverse Events (AEs) be coded and categorized (e.g., using MedDRA)? How will the severity grading (1-5) be applied consistently?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For Aim 4 (resistance), explain how resistance in E. coli (not Shigella) informs the study aims. Why look at E. coli prevalence specifically?\n",
    "\n",
    "**IV. Statistical Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Primary Analysis (Aim 1):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Why use Fisher's Exact test instead of a Chi-Squared test for comparing proportions? What are the assumptions of Fisher's Exact test?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   How is the two-sided 95% CI for the risk difference calculated? Are there different methods (e.g., Newcombe, Wald), and why choose one over the others?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   How exactly is the lower bound of this 95% CI compared to the -10% margin to declare non-inferiority?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Secondary Analyses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For Aims 1 & 2 (Day 7/30 failure): The methods seem identical to the primary aim. Are there any subtleties or different considerations for these later time points?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For Aim 3 (AEs): The SAP says \"no hypothesis tests.\" How will AEs be summarized (e.g., frequency tables by severity and system organ class)? How will we informally compare safety between arms without formal testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For Aim 4 (Resistance):\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   What is GEE (Generalized Estimating Equations)? Why is it suitable here for analyzing resistance prevalence at Day 7 and Day 30?\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   What do the \"logit link\" and \"Poisson link\" mean? Why might Poisson be used if logit fails?\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   What is an \"auto-regressive correlation structure\" versus an \"exchangeable correlation structure\"? Why choose one? How does this account for repeated measures on the same child (if applicable, though here it seems to be resistance at Day 7 and at Day 30)?\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   Why compare resistance proportions among children (treating absence of E. coli as susceptible) rather than just among the isolates obtained? What are the pros and cons of this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Handling Adherence & Deviations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   How will the secondary analysis looking at adherence (\"exclude children who did not have complete adherence\") be performed and interpreted, given it breaks randomization?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   How might major protocol deviations (e.g., wrong treatment, ineligible patient) be handled in sensitivity analyses beyond the defined PP analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Alpha Spending/Multiplicity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The SAP states no adjustment for multiple testing for secondary outcomes. What are the implications of this? How should we interpret p-values for secondary outcomes?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   For the interim analysis, a very stringent alpha (0.03% one-sided) is mentioned for stopping for potential harm (Tebi \\> Cef). Why is it so low? How was this threshold determined (e.g., O'Brien-Fleming, Pocock boundary)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The SAP states \"no alpha spending...is being spent at the interim\" for the NI outcome. Can you clarify what this means? Does the interim look only check for harm/futility, not early efficacy/NI?\n",
    "\n",
    "**V. Interim Analysis & DSMB/DSMC**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Interim Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   What specific data points and analyses will be presented to the DSMC at the interim stage (n=66)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   The stopping rule mentions \"Prob (Risk Difference \\> 0) \\>= 99.7%\". Is this a Bayesian probability calculation? If so, what priors are used? Or is it based on the frequentist CI/p-value (e.g., the p-value for superiority of Ceftriaxone being \\< 0.003)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   What does the DSMC consider besides the primary outcome failure rates (e.g., safety data, recruitment rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**VI. Software & Reporting**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Implementation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   What specific functions or packages in STATA or R would be used for the GEE models? For the NI CI calculation? For Fisher's Exact test?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   How will the results be presented in tables and figures for the final report/publication? (e.g., CONSORT flow diagram, baseline characteristics table, outcome tables showing N, %, risk difference, CI, p-value).\n",
    "\n",
    "**VII. Deeper Understanding & Critical Thinking**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Assumptions & Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   What are the key statistical assumptions underlying the chosen analysis methods (e.g., for CIs, GEE)? What happens if these assumptions are violated?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   What are the main limitations of this study design and analysis plan?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Alternative Approaches:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Were other statistical approaches considered for the primary or secondary analyses? Why were the current methods chosen over alternatives?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   If tebipenem is found to be non-inferior, what is the practical clinical interpretation? What if the result is \"inconclusive\" (e.g., scenario E or F in Figure 1)?\n"
